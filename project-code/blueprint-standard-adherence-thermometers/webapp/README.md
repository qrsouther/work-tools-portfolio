- ‚úÖ API keys are stored only in browser localStorage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Restrict your Google API key to Sheets API only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only use with sheets that are okay to be publicly viewable

## Customization

You can customize the appearance by editing the `<style>` section in `index.html`:

- **Colors**: Change `#0052CC` (primary blue) to your brand color
- **Fonts**: Modify `font-family` values
- **Row Limit**: Change `slice(1, 51)` to show more/fewer rows
- **Table Styling**: Adjust padding, borders, hover effects

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch spreadsheet"
- Verify your Spreadsheet ID is correct
- Check that the sheet is set to "Anyone with the link can view"
- Ensure your API key is valid and has Sheets API enabled

### "API key not valid"
- Make sure you copied the entire API key
- Check that the API key isn't restricted to wrong domains
- Verify Google Sheets API is enabled in your project

### Blank/Empty Tables
- Check that your sheets have data
- Verify the first row contains headers
- Try clicking "Refresh" to reload

### CORS Errors
- Make sure you're accessing via HTTP/HTTPS, not `file://`
- Host the file on a proper web server

## Advanced: URL Parameters

You can pre-configure the dashboard via URL parameters:

```
https://your-url.com/index.html?spreadsheetId=ABC123&apiKey=xyz
```

This is useful for creating multiple dashboard instances for different sheets.
